> Interpolation search: Based on the principle of searching in a phone book or, for example, in a dictionary. Instead of comparing each element with the desired one, as in linear search, this algorithm predicts the location of the element: the search occurs like a binary search, but instead of dividing the search area into two parts, the interpolating search evaluates the new search area by the distance between the key and the current value of the element.
